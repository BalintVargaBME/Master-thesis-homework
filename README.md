# Distance measurement based on stereo images
## Requirements for running script

Libraries:
- CV2
- Ultralytics (YOLO)
- Numpy

  
In some parts of the code paths need to be given:
- Left image path (image_2_path) to 000008_L.png
- Right image path (image_3_path) to 000008_R.png
- Path of folder where YOLO detections should be saved (labels_output_path)

Then farther down:
- Path to left image detections txt (labels_2_txt_path) generated by the script
- Path to right image detections txt (labels_3_txt_path) generated bythe script

Then farther down again:
- Path to calibration file  (calibration_file_path) 000008_calibration.txt

Then farther down finally:
- Path to KITTI label (kitty_gt_path) 000008_kitti_gt.txt

## Results

The results can be found at the end of the script as well

The ID-s of the cars can be seen on Left_det_w_id.png

- For ID0 on the left image:
    Estimated distance: 10.28 m
    Actual distance: 3.68 m
    Error: 6.60 m

- For ID1 on the left image:
    Estimated distance: 7.46 m
    Actual distance: 7.86 m
    Error: 0.40 m

- For ID2 on the left image:
    Estimated distance: 6.97 m
    Actual distance: 6.15 m
    Error: 0.82 m
